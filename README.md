# House-Price-Prediction-Project
This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using the California housing dataset. The project involves several key steps, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and model building. The primary objective is to develop a linear regression model to estimate house prices based on various features.

## Project Structure
#### Data Exploration:
- Analyzed the California housing dataset to understand its structure and key statistics.
- Performed EDA to visualize feature distributions and relationships with the target variable (SalePrice).
#### Visualization:
- Generated various plots using Seaborn and Plotly, including pair plots, histograms, and linear regression plots.
- Addressed data skewness and transformed the target variable for better model performance.
#### Model Building:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Built and trained a linear regression model.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
#### Results:
- Identified key features with significant correlation to house prices.
- Achieved an RMSE of 0.224, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting house prices.
